Study the output of `yx context docs`

Work on documenting the next feature. Read the code and the executable tests (specs) to discover the behaviour. Try to document business rules, and leave the concrete examples to the tests, as much as possible.

if there's anything you're not sure about, update the context for the sub-yak for the specific feature you're working on with your questions, but do your best to document what you *do* understand.

If you think you're done with a feature, mark the sub-yak for it as done, and update the context on the docs yak. Only mark the "docs" yak done when all the features are documented, and you have reviewed them all for consistency.
